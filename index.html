# Data manipulation, analysis and visualisation in Python

Specialist course Doctoral schools of Ghent University, 19-21 December 2016

Joris Van den Bossche, Stijn Van Hoey

https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche/DS-python-data-analysis


---

# Setting up a working environment

* Working on a PC from the computer room [1]:

  * Ensure you have a helios account: http://helpdesk.ugent.be/account/helios.php
  * Log in at https://snake.ugent.be
  * Start a Terminal: `New` (upper right) > `Terminal`

* Working on your own laptop [2]

---
# Getting the course materials

* With using git ([1] and recommended for [2])

  First time (inside a terminal or cmd):

  ```
$ git clone https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche/DS-python-data-analysis.git
$ cd DS-python-data-analysis
  ```

  Updating (on second or third day):

  ```
  $ git pull
  ```

* Without git for [2]: download ZIP from https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche/DS-python-data-analysis (green button "Clone or download")

---

# Create an environment with Anaconda (for [2])
(*make sure you have a working internet connection*)

Use our [environment.yml](https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche/DS-python-data-analysis/blob/master/environment.yml) file inside the course folder to set up your Python working environment

In a terminal or cmd, navigate to the `DS-python-data-analysis` folder and use the following command:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

---

# Create an environment with Anaconda (for [2])
(*make sure you have a working internet connection*)

When the environment is installed, activate the environment inside the terminal/cmd:

* Windows-users
```
$ activate DS-python-data-analysis
```

* Linux/Mac-users
```
$ source activate DS-python-data-analysis
```

---
# Starting a Jupyter Notebook (for [2])

* In the terminal, navigate to the `DS-python-data-analysis` directory if not there already

* Ensure that the correct environment is activated.

* Start a jupyter notebook server with

  ```
$ jupyter notebook
  ```

  This will open a browser window automatically.

# Why python?

---
class: center, middle

# Python is...

---

## …OPEN SOURCE
* No license costs!

---

## …WIDESPREAD
* Large world-wide community ensures **fast development**
* Used in **scientific** and non-scientific institutes <br> (Google, NASA, ESRI, VMM,...)
* Python is a standard in **GIS** <br> (commercial and non-commercial tools)
* **Multiplatform** (linux, windows,…)

---

## …READABLE

.center[
```
It's easy to learn, easy to read and fast to develop
```
]
<br><br><br>

---

## …REPRODUCIBLE

.center[

instead of
```
what did you/I clicked a few months ago?’-style WYSISYG
```
]

---

## …MULTI-FUNCTIONAL

* Research and development: the python *scientific ecosystem*
* Daily use: great as ductape/glue
* **Automation** of time-consuming returning tasks

---

## ...SO WHAT? The Holy Grail ? No!
* Commercial packages give specific support  and more direct help-functions (cfr. MATLAB)
* Commercial packages can be more client-friendly
* For hard numercrunching stuff, NOT the fastest solution
* Fortran, C++ etc are also ‘widespread’, so python is just a language amongst the others
* Risk of getting lost in the forest/flood of ‘useful packages’

* [**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Popular for web-development and Django applications, powerful when doing 'real' development (packages, libraries, software)
* [Eclipse + **pyDev plugin**](http://www.pydev.org/): If you like working in Eclipse, just add the python environment

## Pandas: data analysis in python

For data-intensive work in Python the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) library has become essential.

What is `pandas`?

* Pandas can be thought of as *NumPy arrays with labels* for rows and columns, and better support for heterogeneous data types, but it's also much, much more than that.
* Pandas can also be thought of as `R`'s `data.frame` in Python.
* Powerful for working with missing data, working with time series data, for reading and writing your data, for reshaping, grouping, merging your data, ...

It's documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

---

# When do you need pandas?

When working with **tabular or structured data** (like R dataframe, SQL table, Excel spreadsheet, ...):

- Import data
- Clean up messy data
- Explore data, gain insight into data
- Process and prepare your data for analysis
- Analyse your data (together with scikit-learn, statsmodels, ...)


---

## Key features

* Fast, easy and flexible input/output for a lot of different data formats
* Working with missing data (`.dropna()`, `pd.isnull()`)
* Merging and joining (`concat`, `join`)
* Grouping: `groupby` functionality
* Reshaping (`stack`, `pivot`)
* Powerful time series manipulation (resampling, timezones, ..)
* Easy plotting

---

# Let's get to it!

  1. Data structures
  2. Basic Operations
  3. Indexing and selecting data
  4. Time series data
  5. Combining data - concat


* Case study: bike count data
